The algorithm is a variation of the expectation-maximization algorithm 
of Dawid and Skene from the paper.
Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Observer Error-Rates Using the EM Algorithm, 
Applied Statistics, Vol. 28, No. 1. (1979), pp. 20-28. The algorithm runs in 
rounds, performing the following steps in each round

#. Using the labels given by multiple workers, estimate the most likely "correct" label for each object.

#. Based on the estimated correct answer for each object, compute the error rates for each worker.

#. Taking into consideration the error rates for each worker, recompute the most likely "correct" label for each object.

#. Go to step 2
