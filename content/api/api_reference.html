<p>
    The DSaS API is organized around REST. Our API is designed to have 
    predictable, resource-oriented URLS, to use HTTP response codes to indicate 
    API errors, and to use built-in HTTP features. JSON will be returned in all 
    responses from the API, including errors.

            <h3>Service</h3>
            <p>
                Class <code>com.datascience.gal.service.Service</code> is a 
                web-service container, binded to the 
                <code>http://23.21.128.180:8080/GetAnotherLabel/rest url</code>, 
                could be runned locally on 
                <code>[SERVER HOST:PORT]/GetAnotherLabel/rest</code>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Be aware that url is not correct till the right web-method 
                [with parameter[s]] `s[`ve] been added, such as (please be 
                familiar with <i>Summary of Resource URL Patterns</i> 
                section) <code>reset, exists, loadCategories</code> e.g.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Brief Intro</h3>
            <p>
                To setup locally the project you may need Maven (3.x.x) 
                (cmd mvn --version), Tomcat 6, JRE/JDK(1.6, 6.x.0_x), MySQL. 
            </p>
            <p>
                MSQL is needed ONLY if you are suppose to use Web-Service 
                named Service, for other purposes of using DSaS you may be 
                interested in reading

            <h3>What for do we need database? Which Pitfalls could we be 
                faced with?</h3>
            <p>
                We need database to save to/load from by Id any data structure, 
                such as
                <code>BatchDawidSkene/IncrementalDawidSkene, Category</code>,
                various collections e.g. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Every web-method which contain id parameter always refers to
                the specific record of the table in database. Yes, right, ONE
                table, which gives a hand every entity, of any type, any time.
                Web-methods are NOT syncronized at the current stage of development.
                Table COULD contain duplicate data. 
            </p>
            <h3>Which type of data is expected? How to test? In which order? 
                Is it critical to keep some ordering of calling?</h3>
            <p>
                Usually <code>id</code> may not be only numeric, you may try
                any characters. Data should has JSON type, to generate 
                <code>Category</code> or <code>Collection of categories</code> 
                you may use 
                <a href="http://23.21.128.180:8080/GetAnotherLabel/rest/compose/composeDSForm" target="_blank">Composer</a>.
                Also you may try 
                <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/download.html" target="_blank">cURL</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Web-methods are splitted by two groups, POST and GET oriented.
                To test GET methods you may just type in browser specific url,
                to test POST web-methods you may create simple html file with form. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Order of testing is important because you need to be sure that
                data which you treat exists. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Order of calling depends of previous executions. For instance
                every method name of which starts from
                <code>load (loadCategories, loadGoldLabels)</code>
                stores/updates object
                <code>BatchDawidSkene/IncrementalDawidSkene</code>
                to/into the database. Afterwards any other web-method may use
                that object by specific <code>id</code> which you may keep in
                mind. None of the methods return list of objects, JFYI.
