How to use

----------

To use DSaS service you must create a request with unique ID and service URL configured.

Then you must execute three steps :

 

 - data upload

 - algorithm execution (computeBlocking)

 - results download

 

It is possible to download results before executing algorithm but that will result in

worthless data, so you must be sure that you called *computeBlocking* function before

downloading results.

 

 

Client classes

--------------

DSaS client provides classes that assure compatibility between models used in server and client environment.

Beside those classes client also contains factories that allow simple creation of object required by

DSaS server. Those classes are used only for data compatibility in communication with service and do

not create any sort of object model so data verification must be handled in outside code.

 

 

Basic classes

-------------

Category

~~~~~~~~

Category contains information about category name and it misclassification cost.

It also provides, as static constants, default values of misclassification costs for right

and wrong classification, and default category priority.

 

 

GoldLabel

~~~~~~~~~

Represents a correct label, contains object name and name of object category.

 

Label

~~~~~

Represents single label created by worker.

Contains object name, worker name and category name

 

MisclassificationCost

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cost of incorrect classification contains cost value, category from and category to.

Category from holds name of category that was

 

Factories

---------

CategoryFactory

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allows simple creation of category class objects.

The most basic way to do it is to call function **createCategories** with collection

of String objects representing category names. This will result in creation of categories with

given names an default misclassification costs. This is perfect approach if you do not need to

create nonstandard misclassification cost maps as it allows you to completely ignore this part

of DSaS model and simplifies it use. To be able to create more complex classification models

you can simply pass another argument, this time of type Map<String,Map<String,Double>>, representing

misclassification cost matrix. Correct format of this map is that first key indicates from what and second to

with category  cost is in map. So  if one will call a function *costs.get("CategoryA").get("CategoryB")*, where

"costs" is correctly formatted misclassification matrix, it will return cost of misclassification in situation when

object that belong to *CateogryA* was classified as *CategoryB*.

 

MissclassificationCostFactory

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's used to create MisclassificationCost basing on input of Category collection. Category

object in input must contain their misclassification maps in correct format.

 

DawidSkeneRequest

-----------------

DawidSkeneRequest is most important class in DSaS client, it represents single request to service.

Sometimes, especially in DSaS inter works descriptions, request may be called DSaS model. From client

side request is identified by service URL and request ID. Request object to not contain any data besides

that required for it identification, however it provides access to data stored in DSaS server and enables

access to it services. All methods throw IOException if connection to DSaS failed.

 

 

String ping()

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pings DSaS, used to check if service is working at all and returns information about exact moment of ping.

 

String pingDatabase()

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adds and removes one row in database. Used for checking if database is working.

Returns information about results of database operations.

 

String reset()

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Restets DawidSkene model, in other words removes request with id of one that called

this method from database. It returns information about success or failue of operation.

 

boolean exists()

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Return True if DSaS contains request with id of one that called this method.

 

String loadCategories(Collection<Category> categories)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Uploads categories, given as a argument, to data model of this request.

Returns String with information about category count and their JSONified form.

 

String loadMisclassificationCosts(Collection<MisclassificationCost> costs)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Uploads misclassification costs, given as a argument, to data model of this request.

Returns String  with information about number of misclassification costs added.

 

String loadLabel(Label label)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Uploads a single worker assigned label to data model of this request and

returns String describing added label.

 

String loadLabels(Collection<Label> labels)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Uploads a collection of labels to data model of this request and

returns String describing number of labels added.

 

String loadGoldLabel(GoldLabel label)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Uploads a single gold label to data model of this request and

returns String describing added label.

 

String loadGoldLabels(Collection<GoldLabel> labels)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Uploads a collection of gold labels to data model of this request and

returns String describing number of labels added.

 

String majorityVote(String objectName)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Computes majority vote for object with name given as parameter.

Returns name of category with highest probability of fitting given object.

 

Map<String, String> majorityVotes(Collection<String> objects)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Computes majority vote for group of objects with names included in

collection that's given as a parameter. **If this function is called without

parameter majority vote is computed for all objects held in request data model.**

Returns map that assigns name of category to object name.

 

Map<String, Double> objectProb(String objectName)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Computes category probabilities for object with given name and

returns map that associates category name with it probability.

 

Map<String, Map<String, Double>> objectProbs(Collection<String> objects)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Computes category probabilities for group of objects with names included in

collection that's given as a parameter.

Returns map that associates object names with their probability maps.

 

Map<String, Double> objectProb(String object, double entropy)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Calculates object probabilities and returns them only if their

entropy is equal or above level given as a parameter. If

entropy is smaller then parameter this function returns

empty map.

 

String printObjectsProbs(double entropy)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creates String with readable representation of probabilities of the

objects that have probability distributions with entropy higher than the

given threshold.

 

String computeBlocking(int iterations)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Runs Dawid-Skene algorithm, with given number of iterations, on request data and returns string

that describes how many iterations were execudet and how much time

it took.

 

String printWorkerSummary(boolean verbose)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepares String with summaries of all workers that participated in

this request. It is possible to set if summaries should be detailed or not.

 

String printPriors()

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns priorities of all classes from this request in readable format.

 

Map<String, Double> classPriors()

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Function retrieves priorities of all classes in request and puts them in

map that associates class name with it priority.
